			transform author information into multidimensional numerical

			to the machine.

			The result produces sometimes surprising connections, and we must be clear
			about what these connections reveal: these links are artificial. They
			proceed from no literary analysis in the traditional sense, rely on no
			knowledge of historical contexts, acknowledged influences, or aesthetic
			debates that actually traverse the works. The algorithm operates on
			linguistic patterns, lexical recurrences, syntactic structures, producing
			associations that say more about the biases of training corpora than about
			genuine literary kinships. Yet these mechanical approximations present a
			singular documentary interest. They offer a window into how machines
			process language, the implicit categories they construct, their particular
			way of <i>reading</i> without understanding.
			<br />
			<br />
			This project therefore explores less literature itself than the technical
			mediations that now interpose between readers and works, questioning what
			we accept to delegate to machines in our relationship to culture.
